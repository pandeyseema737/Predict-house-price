#Predict-house-price

This is part of assignment for Data Science Professional Certification. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

I cleaned, visualized and summarized data using Pandas. Using Scikit-learn, I developed Data Pipelines, constructed Machine learning models for Regression and evaluated these models.
